#+AUTHOR: Tyler Griffiths

* Aim

This aims to be a reasonably featureful and complete interface
to AAISP's control APIs, as well as the SMS sending API. 
The main purpose is to look up various bits of data regarding
an account.

* Usage

Make available the environment variables in aavars, including
control usernames and passwords. Don't set these files to be
globally readable!

The =aa= script documents itself in use, call =aa help=.
